# Sample Page with Frontmatter

This is an example of how your OneNote pages will look after being converted with the enhanced OneNote2MD tool that includes frontmatter with created and modified dates.

## Key Features Added

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Each page now includes metadata at the top
2. **Created Date**: Extracted from OneNote's `dateTime` attribute  
3. **Modified Date**: Extracted from OneNote's `lastModifiedTime` attribute
4. **Obsidian Compatibility**: The frontmatter format is fully compatible with Obsidian

## Benefits for Obsidian Users

- **Better Organization**: Use created/modified dates for sorting and filtering
- **Timeline Views**: Create timeline views based on creation dates
- **Search & Filter**: Filter notes by date ranges in Obsidian
- **Dataview Plugin**: Use dates in Dataview queries for advanced note management

The original content of your OneNote pages remains unchanged, with all formatting, images, tables, and other elements preserved exactly as before.
